My name is King Leung.
I live and work in the Greater New York city area.
I split my childhood between Hong Kong and Queens, NY.

I'm a self-taught programmer and would love to further my career in this field.

I'm currently working as an ERP developer supporting the corporate Finance/Accounting business users.
I would like add more FinTech tools to my skillset.
